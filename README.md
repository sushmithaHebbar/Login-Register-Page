Summary:
    The provided README gives an overview of the project structure, component responsibilities, and how to run the application. Ensure you have MongoDB set up and configured in your backend for handling user authentication and data storage as per your assignment requirements. Adjust the backend routes and functionalities (server.js, controllers, models) accordingly to integrate with MongoDB for user registration and login functionalities.
